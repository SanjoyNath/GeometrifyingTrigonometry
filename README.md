Algebraic Structure of Geometrifying Trigonometry

We have defined Several operations of Geometrifying Trigonometry which looks similar to that of Vector Algebra but the definitions of Equality , Definitions of Summations , Definitions of Toe Tips are all very much different and too much rigid in case of Geometrifying Trigonometry.

Although we use Vector Algebra to model several real life problems , We can use Geometrifying Trigonometry for several mathematical modeling systems to generate alternative identity conditions , or several types of visualization problems or to model scenario analysis where space planning is necessary

We have checked that many of such operations are not completely cross verified yet in CAD programming.We are working with checking of Associativity for all 7 types of * operations and also for Other operations.We are trying to search best algorithms or redefinitions regarding PIVOT , ALIGN,SCALE TO FIT of ∞ operation where as we have seen through simulations that ∞/ and ∞\ works best
